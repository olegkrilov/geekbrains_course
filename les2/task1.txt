# Установите СУБД MySQL. Создайте в домашней директории файл .my.cnf, задав в нем логин и пароль, который указывался при установке.

# Created file .my.cnf, as was told on the lesson, but this didn't work - however still received errors:
# ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user .....
# After some research found a way, how to avoid such errors in windows using special util - mysql_config_editor
# And this solved the issue!
